### Project Overview
<p align="center">
Rosa is a biological researcher; she's currently researching bacteria species that have the ability to synthesis proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with "Improbable Beef", a food start up to research to research candidate species. There has been prior success synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and micro-organisms found on plant roots. However, "Improbable Beef" is still seeking that elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste. Rosa has a hypothesis these bacteria can be found on the human body, specifically within some individuals belly buttons. Now, utilizing Rosa data set of all her samples I have been tasked to create a dashboard to visually provide our participants with her findings, while keeping every participant anonymous.
